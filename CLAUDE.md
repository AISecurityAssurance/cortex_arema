# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
Cortex Arena is a security analysis platform that compares threat assessments from multiple Claude AI models. Users upload architecture diagrams, select analysis templates (STRIDE, STPA-Sec, or custom), and receive comparative security findings from different models.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.2 with App Router
- **React**: 19.1.0
- **TypeScript**: 5.9.2 (strict mode)
- **State Management**: Zustand 5.0.6
- **UI Framework**: AWS Cloudscape Design System (active migration - see CLOUDSCAPE_MIGRATION_SPEC.md)
- **Backend**: FastAPI server at localhost:8000

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint

# Production build
npm run build
```

## Architecture & Key Patterns

### State Management Architecture
- **Zustand stores** for templates (`lib/storage/templateStore.ts`)
- **LocalStorage persistence** for sessions (`lib/storage/sessionStorage.ts`)
- **React Context** for cross-cutting concerns (Toast notifications, Theme)

### Component Architecture
```
src/app/analysis/AnalysisView.tsx      # Main analysis orchestrator
src/components/layout/AnalysisLayout.tsx # Three-panel layout container
src/components/analysis/ModelComparisonView.tsx # Side-by-side model results
src/components/validation/ValidationControls.tsx # Finding validation UI
```

### Data Flow
1. User uploads image â†’ AI validation â†’ Session created
2. Template selected â†’ Prompt generated â†’ Models called in parallel
3. Results parsed â†’ Findings extracted â†’ Displayed for comparison
4. User validates findings â†’ Progress tracked â†’ Session persisted

### Session Management
Sessions are persisted to localStorage with atomic operations to prevent data corruption. Each session contains:
- Model selections (A/B comparison)
- Analysis results from both models
- Validation data with multi-dimensional scoring
- Progress metrics

## Critical Implementation Details

### Model Integration
Backend API at `http://localhost:8000/generate` expects:
```typescript
{
  model_id: string,      // e.g., "us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-20250514-v1:0"
  prompt: string,
  images?: string[],     // Base64 encoded
  system_instructions: string
}
```

### Finding Extraction
The system extracts structured findings from unstructured model responses using:
- Pattern matching for severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Multi-format support (STRIDE categories, STPA-SEC hazards, custom formats)
- Located in `src/lib/analysis/findingExtractor.ts`

### Validation System
Findings are validated with:
- Status: confirmed, false-positive, needs-review, pending
- Multi-dimensional scoring: accuracy, completeness, relevance, actionability
- Progress tracking with automatic calculation

## Active Migration: Cloudscape Design System

**IMPORTANT**: UI components are being migrated to AWS Cloudscape. Before modifying any UI:
1. Check `CLOUDSCAPE_MIGRATION_SPEC.md` for migration status
2. Use Cloudscape components when available
3. Preserve all existing functionality
4. Test thoroughly after changes

Migration phases:
- Phase 1: Foundation (âœ… Complete)
- Phase 2: Layout & Navigation (ðŸ”„ In Progress)
- Phase 3: Core Components (ðŸ“‹ Planned)

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Model
1. Add model configuration to `src/types/index.ts` (ModelConfig)
2. Update model lists in `src/app/analysis/AnalysisView.tsx`
3. Ensure backend supports the model ID

### Creating New Templates
1. Use the Template Editor UI at `/templates`
2. Templates support variables like `{{threat_type}}`, `{{analysis_scope}}`
3. Templates are stored in localStorage via Zustand

### Debugging Tips
- **Toast notifications not showing**: Verify ToastProvider wraps the component
- **Infinite loops**: Check useEffect dependencies, especially object comparisons
- **Session persistence issues**: Clear localStorage if corrupted
- **Model errors**: Verify backend is running and accessible

## Important Patterns to Follow

### Error Handling
- Use toast notifications for user feedback
- Wrap async operations in try-catch blocks
- Log errors to console (debug logging is intentionally kept enabled)

### Component Guidelines
- Use "use client" directive for interactive components
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use absolute imports with @ alias
- Follow existing naming conventions (e.g., `ModelComparisonView`, not `ModelComparison`)

### Type Safety
- Never use `any` type
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Validate external data (API responses, localStorage)

## Security Considerations
- No API keys or secrets in frontend code
- Image validation before processing
- Input sanitization for prompts
- CORS restricted to localhost

## Testing Strategy
Currently no automated tests exist. When implementing tests:
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for React components
- Integration tests for API interactions
- E2E tests for critical user workflows
